In this document, I am going to present the business requirements for summer project 001 (SP001).

The purpose of summer projects series is to demonstrate my programming skills.

summer project 001 is to present my java development skills with a focus on automations

That is, summer project 001 is to automate a website.

I choose to automate the process of creating a google email account.

Here are the steps:
1. Set up Selenium IDE by downloading it from selenium.org.
   Download firefox, firepath, and firebug
   Download selenium standalone jar file and related selenium files
   Download eclipse and make sure you have junit
2. Record the process of creating a google email account
   Export the test case as a .java file
3. Copy the java code from your exportation and edit it on eclipse
4. Comment on the specific and common usage of java code in automation

Implementation Correctoin
1. export test case as java file throught junit webdriver
2. you have to debug what you copy on eclipse by importing selenium files (only 2 in total)
3. re-runing and debug

Difficult parts:
